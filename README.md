# The project has been developed using React, TypeScript and Redux TK

Moreover, I have used raw css for little styling. As far as testcases are concerned they don't work as fully.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This will run the testcase which isn't fully completed.


### Below are the screenshots of the test
